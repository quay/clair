# Fedora

Docker is supported on Fedora version 22 and 23. This page instructs you to install
using Docker-managed release packages and installation mechanisms. Using these
packages ensures you get the latest release of Docker. If you wish to install
using Fedora-managed packages, consult your Fedora release documentation for
information on Fedora's Docker support.

## Prerequisites

Docker requires a 64-bit installation regardless of your Fedora version. Also, your kernel must be 3.10 at minimum. To check your current kernel
version, open a terminal and use `uname -r` to display your kernel version:

    $ uname -r
    3.19.5-100.fc21.x86_64

If your kernel is at a older version, you must update it.

Finally, is it recommended that you fully update your system. Please keep in
mind that your system should be fully patched to fix any potential kernel bugs. Any
reported kernel bugs may have already been fixed on the latest kernel packages


## Install

There are two ways to install Docker Engine.  You can install with the `dnf` package manager. Or you can use `curl` with the  `get.docker.com` site. This second method runs an installation script which also installs via the `dnf` package manager.

### Install with DNF

1. Log into your machine as a user with `sudo` or `root` privileges.

2. Make sure your existing dnf packages are up-to-date.

		$ sudo dnf update

3. Add the yum repo yourself.

        $ sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
        [dockerrepo]
        name=Docker Repository
        baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/fedora/$releasever/
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
        EOF

4. Install the Docker package.

        $ sudo dnf install docker-engine

5. Start the Docker daemon.

		$ sudo systemctl start docker

6. Verify `docker` is installed correctly by running a test image in a container.


        $ sudo docker run hello-world
        Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
        latest: Pulling from hello-world
        a8219747be10: Pull complete
        91c95931e552: Already exists
        hello-world:latest: The image you are pulling has been verified. Important: image verification is a tech preview feature and should not be relied on to provide security.
        Digest: sha256:aa03e5d0d5553b4c3473e89c8619cf79df368babd1.7.1cf5daeb82aab55838d
        Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
        Hello from Docker.
        This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

        To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
         1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
         2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
            (Assuming it was not already locally available.)
         3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
            executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
         4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
            to your terminal.

        To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
         $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

        For more examples and ideas, visit:
         http://docs.docker.com/userguide/


### Install with the script


1. Log into your machine as a user with `sudo` or `root` privileges.

2. Make sure your existing dnf packages are up-to-date.

		$ sudo dnf update

3. Run the Docker installation script.

		$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

	This script adds the `docker.repo` repository and installs Docker.

4. Start the Docker daemon.

        $ sudo systemctl start docker

5. Verify `docker` is installed correctly by running a test image in a container.

		$ sudo docker run hello-world

## Create a docker group

The `docker` daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default
that Unix socket is owned by the user `root` and other users can access it with
`sudo`. For this reason, `docker` daemon always runs as the `root` user.

To avoid having to use `sudo` when you use the `docker` command, create a Unix
group called `docker` and add users to it. When the `docker` daemon starts, it
makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the `docker` group.

>**Warning**: The `docker` group is equivalent to the `root` user; For details
>on how this impacts security in your system, see [*Docker Daemon Attack
>Surface*](../../security/security.md#docker-daemon-attack-surface) for details.

To create the `docker` group and add your user:

1. Log into your system as a user with `sudo` privileges.

2. Create the `docker` group and add your user.

    `sudo usermod -aG docker your_username`

3. Log out and log back in.

    This ensures your user is running with the correct permissions.

4. Verify your work by running `docker` without `sudo`.

        $ docker run hello-world

## Start the docker daemon at boot

To ensure Docker starts when you boot your system, do the following:

    $ sudo systemctl enable docker

If you need to add an HTTP Proxy, set a different directory or partition for the
Docker runtime files, or make other customizations, read our Systemd article to
learn how to [customize your Systemd Docker daemon options](../../admin/systemd.md).

## Running Docker with a manually-defined network

If you manually configure your network using `systemd-network` with `systemd` version 219 or higher, containers you start with Docker may be unable to access your network.
Beginning with version 220, the forwarding setting for a given network (`net.ipv4.conf.<interface>.forwarding`) defaults to *off*. This setting prevents IP forwarding. It also conflicts with Docker which enables the `net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding` setting within a container.

To work around this, edit the `<interface>.network` file in
`/usr/lib/systemd/network/` on your Docker host  (ex: `/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network`) add the following block:

```
[Network]
...
IPForward=kernel
# OR
IPForward=true
...
```

This configuration allows IP forwarding from the container as expected.

## Uninstall

You can uninstall the Docker software with `dnf`.

1. List the package you have installed.

		$ dnf list installed | grep docker dnf list installed | grep docker
		docker-engine.x86_64     1.7.1-0.1.fc21 @/docker-engine-1.7.1-0.1.fc21.el7.x86_64

2. Remove the package.

		$ sudo dnf -y remove docker-engine.x86_64

	This command does not remove images, containers, volumes, or user-created
	configuration files on your host.

3. To delete all images, containers, and volumes, run the following command:

		$ rm -rf /var/lib/docker

4. Locate and delete any user-created configuration files.

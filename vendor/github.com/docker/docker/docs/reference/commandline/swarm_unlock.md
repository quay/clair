# swarm unlock

```markdown
Usage:	docker swarm unlock

Unlock swarm

Options:
      --help   Print usage
```

Unlocks a locked manager using a user-supplied unlock key. This command must be
used to reactivate a manager after its Docker daemon restarts if the autolock
setting is turned on. The unlock key is printed at the time when autolock is
enabled, and is also available from the `docker swarm unlock-key` command.


```bash
$ docker swarm unlock
Please enter unlock key:
```

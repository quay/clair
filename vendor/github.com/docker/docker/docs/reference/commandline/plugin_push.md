```markdown
Usage:	docker plugin push [OPTIONS] PLUGIN[:TAG]

Push a plugin to a registry

Options:
      --disable-content-trust   Skip image signing (default true)
      --help                    Print usage
```

Use `docker plugin create` to create the plugin. Once the plugin is ready for distribution,
use `docker plugin push` to share your images to the Docker Hub registry or to a self-hosted one.

Registry credentials are managed by [docker login](login.md).

The following example shows how to push a sample `user/plugin`.

```bash

$ docker plugin ls
ID                  NAME                  TAG                 DESCRIPTION                ENABLED
69553ca1d456        user/plugin           latest              A sample plugin for Docker false
$ docker plugin push user/plugin
```

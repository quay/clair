# docker network ls

    Usage:  docker network ls [OPTIONS]

    Lists all the networks created by the user
      -f, --filter=[]       Filter output based on conditions provided
      --help                Print usage
      --no-trunc            Do not truncate the output
      -q, --quiet           Only display numeric IDs

Lists all the networks the Engine `daemon` knows about. This includes the
networks that span across multiple hosts in a cluster, for example:

```bash
    $ sudo docker network ls
    NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
    7fca4eb8c647        bridge              bridge
    9f904ee27bf5        none                null
    cf03ee007fb4        host                host
    78b03ee04fc4        multi-host          overlay
```

Use the `--no-trunc` option to display the full network id:

```bash
docker network ls --no-trunc
NETWORK ID                                                         NAME                DRIVER
18a2866682b85619a026c81b98a5e375bd33e1b0936a26cc497c283d27bae9b3   none                null                
c288470c46f6c8949c5f7e5099b5b7947b07eabe8d9a27d79a9cbf111adcbf47   host                host                
7b369448dccbf865d397c8d2be0cda7cf7edc6b0945f77d2529912ae917a0185   bridge              bridge              
95e74588f40db048e86320c6526440c504650a1ff3e9f7d60a497c4d2163e5bd   foo                 bridge    
63d1ff1f77b07ca51070a8c227e962238358bd310bde1529cf62e6c307ade161   dev                 bridge
```

## Filtering

The filtering flag (`-f` or `--filter`) format is a `key=value` pair. If there
is more than one filter, then pass multiple flags (e.g. `--filter "foo=bar" --filter "bif=baz"`).
Multiple filter flags are combined as an `OR` filter. For example, 
`-f type=custom -f type=builtin` returns both `custom` and `builtin` networks.

The currently supported filters are:

* id (network's id)
* name (network's name)
* type (custom|builtin)

#### Type

The `type` filter supports two values; `builtin` displays predefined networks
(`bridge`, `none`, `host`), whereas `custom` displays user defined networks.

The following filter matches all user defined networks:

```bash
$ docker network ls --filter type=custom
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
95e74588f40d        foo                 bridge
63d1ff1f77b0        dev                 bridge
```

By having this flag it allows for batch cleanup. For example, use this filter
to delete all user defined networks:

```bash
$ docker network rm `docker network ls --filter type=custom -q`
```

A warning will be issued when trying to remove a network that has containers
attached.

#### Name

The `name` filter matches on all or part of a network's name.

The following filter matches all networks with a name containing the `foobar` string.

```bash
$ docker network ls --filter name=foobar
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
06e7eef0a170        foobar              bridge
```

You can also filter for a substring in a name as this shows:

```bash
$ docker network ls --filter name=foo
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
95e74588f40d        foo                 bridge
06e7eef0a170        foobar              bridge
```

#### ID

The `id` filter matches on all or part of a network's ID.

The following filter matches all networks with an ID containing the
`63d1ff1f77b0...` string.

```bash
$ docker network ls --filter id=63d1ff1f77b07ca51070a8c227e962238358bd310bde1529cf62e6c307ade161
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
63d1ff1f77b0        dev                 bridge
```

You can also filter for a substring in an ID as this shows:

```bash
$ docker network ls --filter id=95e74588f40d
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
95e74588f40d        foo                 bridge

$ docker network ls --filter id=95e
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
95e74588f40d        foo                 bridge
```

# plugin rm

```markdown
Usage:  docker plugin rm [OPTIONS] PLUGIN [PLUGIN...]

Remove one or more plugins

Aliases:
  rm, remove

Options:
      -f, --force  Force the removal of an active plugin
          --help   Print usage
```

Removes a plugin. You cannot remove a plugin if it is enabled, you must disable
a plugin using the [`docker plugin disable`](plugin_disable.md) before removing
it (or use --force, use of force is not recommended, since it can affect
functioning of running containers using the plugin).

The following example disables and removes the `sample-volume-plugin:latest` plugin;

```bash
$ docker plugin disable tiborvass/sample-volume-plugin
tiborvass/sample-volume-plugin

$ docker plugin rm tiborvass/sample-volume-plugin:latest
tiborvass/sample-volume-plugin
```

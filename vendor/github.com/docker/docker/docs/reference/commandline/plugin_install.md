# plugin install

```markdown
Usage:  docker plugin install [OPTIONS] PLUGIN [KEY=VALUE...]

Install a plugin

Options:
      --alias string            Local name for plugin
      --disable                 Do not enable the plugin on install
      --disable-content-trust   Skip image verification (default true)
      --grant-all-permissions   Grant all permissions necessary to run the plugin
      --help                    Print usage

Installs and enables a plugin. Docker looks first for the plugin on your Docker
host. If the plugin does not exist locally, then the plugin is pulled from
the registry. Note that the minimum required registry version to distribute
plugins is 2.3.0


The following example installs `vieus/sshfs` plugin and [set](plugin_set.md) it's env variable
`DEBUG` to 1. Install consists of pulling the plugin from Docker Hub, prompting
the user to accept the list of privileges that the plugin needs, settings parameters
 and enabling the plugin.

```bash
$ docker plugin install vieux/sshfs DEBUG=1

Plugin "vieux/sshfs" is requesting the following privileges:
 - network: [host]
 - device: [/dev/fuse]
 - capabilities: [CAP_SYS_ADMIN]
Do you grant the above permissions? [y/N] y
vieux/sshfs
```

After the plugin is installed, it appears in the list of plugins:

```bash
$ docker plugin ls

ID                  NAME                  TAG                 DESCRIPTION                ENABLED
69553ca1d123        vieux/sshfs           latest              sshFS plugin for Docker    true
```

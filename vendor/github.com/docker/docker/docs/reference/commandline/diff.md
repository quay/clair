## diff

```markdown
Usage:  docker diff CONTAINER

Inspect changes to files or directories on a container's filesystem

Options:
      --help   Print usage
```

List the changed files and directories in a containerá¾¿s filesystem since the
container was created. Three different types of change are tracked:

| Symbol | Description                     |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `A`    | A file or directory was added   |
| `D`    | A file or directory was deleted |
| `C`    | A file or directory was changed |

You can use the full or shortened container ID or the container name set using
`docker run --name` option.

## Examples

Inspect the changes to an `nginx` container:

```bash
$ docker diff 1fdfd1f54c1b

C /dev
C /dev/console
C /dev/core
C /dev/stdout
C /dev/fd

# system df

```markdown
Usage:	docker system df [OPTIONS]

Show docker filesystem usage

Options:
      --help      Print usage
  -v, --verbose   Show detailed information on space usage
```

The `docker system df` command displays information regarding the
amount of disk space used by the docker daemon.

By default the command will just show a summary of the data used:
```bash
$ docker system df
TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              5                   2                   16.43 MB            11.63 MB (70%)
Containers          2                   0                   212 B               212 B (100%)
Local Volumes       2                   1                   36 B                0 B (0%)
```

A more detailed view can be requested using the `-v, --verbose` flag:
```bash
$ docker system df -v

* `SHARED SIZE` is the amount of space that an image shares with another one (i.e. their common data)
* `UNIQUE SIZE` is the amount of space that is only used by a given image
* `SIZE` is the virtual size of the image, it is the sum of `SHARED SIZE` and `UNIQUE SIZE`

Note that network information is not shown because it doesn't consume the disk space.

# kill

    Usage: docker kill [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

    Kill a running container using SIGKILL or a specified signal

      --help                 Print usage
      -s, --signal="KILL"    Signal to send to the container

The main process inside the container will be sent `SIGKILL`, or any
signal specified with option `--signal`.

> **Note:**
> `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in the *shell* form run as a subcommand of `/bin/sh -c`,
> which does not pass signals. This means that the executable is not the containerâ€™s PID 1
> and does not receive Unix signals.

An unlock key is a secret key needed to unlock a manager after its Docker daemon
restarts. These keys are only used when the autolock feature is enabled for the
swarm.

You can view or rotate the unlock key using `swarm unlock-key`. To view the key,
run the `docker swarm unlock-key` command without any arguments:


```bash
$ docker swarm unlock-key
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-fySn8TY4w5lKcWcJPIpKufejh9hxx5KYwx6XZigx3Q4

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
```

Use the `--rotate` flag to rotate the unlock key to a new, randomly-generated
key:

```bash
$ docker swarm unlock-key --rotate
Successfully rotated manager unlock key.

To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
```

The `-q` (or `--quiet`) flag only prints the key:

```bash
$ docker swarm unlock-key -q
SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8
```

### `--rotate`

This flag rotates the unlock key, replacing it with a new randomly-generated
key. The old unlock key will no longer be accepted.

### `--quiet`

Only print the unlock key, without instructions.

# ETW logging driver

The ETW logging driver forwards container logs as ETW events. 
ETW stands for Event Tracing in Windows, and is the common framework
for tracing applications in Windows. Each ETW event contains a message
with both the log and its context information. A client can then create
an ETW listener to listen to these events. 

The ETW provider that this logging driver registers with Windows, has the 
GUID identifier of: `{a3693192-9ed6-46d2-a981-f8226c8363bd}`. A client creates an 
ETW listener and registers to listen to events from the logging driver's provider. 
It does not matter the order in which the provider and listener are created. 
A client can create their ETW listener and start listening for events from the provider, 
before the provider has been registered with the system. 

## Usage

Here is an example of how to listen to these events using the logman utility program 
included in most installations of Windows:

   1. `logman start -ets DockerContainerLogs -p {a3693192-9ed6-46d2-a981-f8226c8363bd} 0 0 -o trace.etl`
   2. Run your container(s) with the etwlogs driver, by adding `--log-driver=etwlogs` 
   to the Docker run command, and generate log messages.
   3. `logman stop -ets DockerContainerLogs`
   4. This will generate an etl file that contains the events. One way to convert this file into 
   human-readable form is to run: `tracerpt -y trace.etl`. 
   
Each ETW event will contain a structured message string in this format:

    container_name: %s, image_name: %s, container_id: %s, image_id: %s, source: [stdout | stderr], log: %s

Details on each item in the message can be found below:

| Field                | Description                                     |
-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `container_name`     | The container name at the time it was started.  |
| `image_name`         | The name of the container's image.              |
| `container_id`       | The full 64-character container ID.             |
| `image_id`           | The full ID of the container's image.           |
| `source`             | `stdout` or `stderr`.                           |
| `log`                | The container log message.                      |

Here is an example event message:

    container_name: backstabbing_spence, 
    image_name: windowsservercore, 
    container_id: f14bb55aa862d7596b03a33251c1be7dbbec8056bbdead1da8ec5ecebbe29731, 
    image_id: sha256:2f9e19bd998d3565b4f345ac9aaf6e3fc555406239a4fb1b1ba879673713824b, 
    source: stdout, 
    log: Hello world!

A client can parse this message string to get both the log message, as well as its 
context information. Note that the time stamp is also available within the ETW event. 

**Note**  This ETW provider emits only a message string, and not a specially 
structured ETW event. Therefore, it is not required to register a manifest file 
with the system to read and interpret its ETW events.

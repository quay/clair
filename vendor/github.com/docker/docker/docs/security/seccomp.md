# Seccomp security profiles for Docker

Secure computing mode (Seccomp) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to
restrict the actions available within the container. The `seccomp()` system
call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. You can use this
feature to restrict your application's access.

This feature is available only if the kernel is configured with `CONFIG_SECCOMP`
enabled.

> **Note**: Seccomp profiles require seccomp 2.2.1 and are only
> available starting with Debian 9 "Stretch", Ubuntu 15.10 "Wily", and
> Fedora 22. To use this feature on Ubuntu 14.04, Debian Wheezy, or
> Debian Jessie, you must download the [latest static Docker Linux binary](../installation/binaries.md).
> This feature is currently *not* available on other distributions.

## Passing a profile for a container

The default seccomp profile provides a sane default for running containers with
seccomp and disables around 44 system calls out of 300+. It is moderately protective while providing wide application
compatibility. The default Docker profile (found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json) has a JSON layout in the following form:

```
{
	"defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
	"architectures": [
		"SCMP_ARCH_X86_64",
		"SCMP_ARCH_X86",
		"SCMP_ARCH_X32"
	],
	"syscalls": [
		{
			"name": "accept",
			"action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
			"args": []
		},
		{
			"name": "accept4",
			"action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
			"args": []
		}
		...
	]
}
```

When you run a container, it uses the default profile unless you override
it with the `security-opt` option. For example, the following explicitly
specifies the default policy:

```
$ docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp:/path/to/seccomp/profile.json hello-world
```

### Significant syscalls blocked by the default profile

Docker's default seccomp profile is a whitelist which specifies the calls that
are allowed. The table below lists the significant (but not all) syscalls that
are effectively blocked because they are not on the whitelist. The table includes
the reason each syscall is blocked rather than white-listed.

| Syscall             | Description                                                                                                                           |

## Run without the default seccomp profile

You can pass `unconfined` to run a container without the default seccomp
profile.

```
$ docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp:unconfined debian:jessie \
    unshare --map-root-user --user sh -c whoami
```

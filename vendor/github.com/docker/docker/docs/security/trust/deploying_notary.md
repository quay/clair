# Deploying Notary Server with Compose

The easiest way to deploy Notary Server is by using Docker Compose. To follow the procedure on this page, you must have already [installed Docker Compose](/compose/install.md).

1. Clone the Notary repository

        git clone git@github.com:docker/notary.git

2. Build and start Notary Server with the sample certificates.

        docker-compose up -d


    For more detailed documentation about how to deploy Notary Server see https://github.com/docker/notary.
3. Make sure that your Docker or Notary client trusts Notary Server's certificate before you try to interact with the Notary server.

See the instructions for [Docker](../../reference/commandline/cli.md#notary) or
for [Notary](https://github.com/docker/notary#using-notary) depending on which one you are using.

## If you want to use Notary in production

Please check back here for instructions after Notary Server has an official
stable release. To get a head start on deploying Notary in production see

Create a new image from an existing container specified by name or
container ID.  The new image will contain the contents of the
container filesystem, *excluding* any data volumes. Refer to **docker-tag(1)**
for more information about valid image and tag names.

While the `docker commit` command is a convenient way of extending an
existing image, you should prefer the use of a Dockerfile and `docker
build` for generating images that you intend to share with other
people.

# EXAMPLES

## Creating a new image from an existing container
An existing Fedora based container has had Apache installed while running
in interactive mode with the bash shell. Apache is also running. To
create a new image run `docker ps` to find the container's ID and then run:

    # docker commit -m="Added Apache to Fedora base image" \
      -a="A D Ministrator" 98bd7fc99854 fedora/fedora_httpd:20

Note that only a-z0-9-_. are allowed when naming images from an 
existing container.

## Apply specified Dockerfile instructions while committing the image
If an existing container was created without the DEBUG environment
variable set to "true", you can create a new image based on that
container by first getting the container's ID with `docker ps` and
then running:

    # docker container commit -c="ENV DEBUG true" 98bd7fc99854 debug-image

List the changed files and directories in a containerá¾¿s filesystem since the
container was created. Three different types of change are tracked:

| Symbol | Description                     |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `A`    | A file or directory was added   |
| `D`    | A file or directory was deleted |
| `C`    | A file or directory was changed |

You can use the full or shortened container ID or the container name set using
**docker run --name** option.

# EXAMPLES

```bash
$ docker diff 1fdfd1f54c1b

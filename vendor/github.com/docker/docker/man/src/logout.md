Log out of a Docker Registry located on the specified `SERVER`. You can
specify a URL or a `hostname` for the `SERVER` value. If you do not specify a
`SERVER`, the command attempts to log you out of Docker's public registry
located at `https://registry-1.docker.io/` by default.  

# EXAMPLES

## Log out from a registry on your localhost

    # docker logout localhost:8080

# See also
**docker-login(1)** to log in to a Docker registry server.

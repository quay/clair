# NAME
docker-tag - Tag an image into a repository

# SYNOPSIS
**docker tag**
[**--help**]
IMAGE[:TAG] [REGISTRY_HOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]

# DESCRIPTION
Assigns a new alias to an image in a registry. An alias refers to the
entire image name including the optional `TAG` after the ':'. 

If you do not specify a `REGISTRY_HOST`, the command uses Docker's public
registry located at `registry-1.docker.io` by default. 

# "OPTIONS"
**--help**
   Print usage statement.

**REGISTRY_HOST**
   The hostname of the registry if required. This may also include the port
separated by a ':'

**USERNAME**
   The username or other qualifying identifier for the image.

**NAME**
   The image name.

**TAG**
   The tag you are assigning to the image.  Though this is arbitrary it is
recommended to be used for a version to distinguish images with the same name.
Also, for consistency tags should only include a-z0-9-_. .
Note that here TAG is a part of the overall name or "tag".

# EXAMPLES

## Giving an image a new alias

Here is an example of aliasing an image (e.g., 0e5574283393) as "httpd" and 
tagging it into the "fedora" repository with "version1.0":

    docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0

## Tagging an image for a private repository

To push an image to a private registry and not the central Docker
registry you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).

    docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0

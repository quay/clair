Swarm initialized: current node (nodeID) is now a manager.

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    unlock-key

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.

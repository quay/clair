The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The \"current\" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. \"75% completed\" means \"75% of [A, C) completed\" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. \"split at 68%\" should be interpreted as \"split at 68% of [A, C)\". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc."

   "description": "The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",

# Config

## CLI Flags And ENV Vars

ClairV4 is provided a structured yaml configuration. 
Each ClairV4 node will specify what mode it will run in and config path via cli flag or environment variable.

For example:
```shell
$ clair -conf ./path/to/config.yaml -mode indexer
$ clair -conf ./path/to/config.yaml -mode matcher
```

```
-mode 
    (also specified by CLAIR_MODE env variable)
    One of the following strings
    Sets which mode the clair instances will run in
    
    "indexer": runs just the indexer node
    "matcher": runs just the matcher node
    "notifier": runs just the notifier node
    "combo":	will run both indexer and matcher on the same node.
-conf
    (also specified by CLAIR_CONF env variable)
    A file system path to Clair's config file
```

The above example starts two Clair nodes using the same configuration. One will only run the indexing facilities while the other will only run the matching facilities.
